    abstract = "We design and release BONIE, the first open numerical relation extractor, for extracting Open IE tuples where one of the arguments is a number or a quantity-unit phrase. BONIE uses bootstrapping to learn the specific dependency patterns that express numerical relations in a sentence. BONIE{'}s novelty lies in task-specific customizations, such as inferring implicit relations, which are clear due to context such as units (for e.g., {`}square kilometers{'} suggests area, even if the word {`}area{'} is missing in the sentence). BONIE obtains 1.5x yield and 15 point precision gain on numerical facts over a state-of-the-art Open IE system.",
